Despite a global decline in TB incidence, it remains a leading public health threat in many countries, responsible for approximately 1.5 million deaths annually. Compounding this issue is the emergence of drug-resistant TB strains, further complicating efforts to control the epidemic.\n\nIn many of the hardest-hit regions, funding for TB control is severely limited, particularly in developing countries. This scarcity of resources makes it imperative to maximize the impact of every intervention.\n\nThrough advanced mathematical modelling, AuTuMN provides a powerful tool for optimizing the use of available funds, helping policymakers and National TB Programs design targeted, cost-effective strategies to reduce TB\u0027s burden.

This adaptability allows us to model specific groups\u2014such as prisoners, Indigenous communities, or urban and rural populations\u2014ensuring that the unique epidemiological characteristics of each group are considered. Additionally, AuTuMN integrates several TB strains into its models, including drug-sensitive TB (DS-TB), multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB), and extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB).\n\nThese models are built with flexibility in mind, designed to replicate the complex transmission dynamics observed in TB-endemic regions. This modular platform supports the addition of a wide range of current and future TB interventions, including Directly Observed Treatment (DOT), diagnostic enhancements, MDR-TB management, active case finding, preventive therapies, and laboratory improvements.\n\nIn addition to transmission modeling, AuTuMN incorporates an economic framework that captures the detailed costs of interventions, which are calculated locally to reflect the real-world financial landscape. This dual approach allows us to generate outputs that address both the epidemiological impact and the financial feasibility of various TB control strategies. By doing so, our models can help forecast the costs and outcomes of different TB interventions, and guide the selection of the most effective and efficient strategies for specific country contexts.","Images/"],["Countries where AuTuMN is involved","","Image356.jpg"]]},{"page_name":"Our Team","content":[["Emma McBryde","MBBS, FRACP, MBiostat, PhD","Professor of Infectious Diseases, University of Queensland and Australian Institute of Tropical Health and Medicine, James Cook University","Australian Institute of Tropical Health and Medicine, James Cook University","Emma McBryde is an infectious diseases physician and did her PhD in mathematical modelling of infectious diseases.

Therefore, the early prediction of poor treatment outcomes may be useful in patient care, especially for clinicians when they have the ability to make treatment decisions or offer counselling or additional support to patients. The aim of this study was to develop a simple clinical risk score to predict poor treatment outcomes in patients with MDR-TB, using routinely collected data from two large countries in geographically distinct regions. METHODS: We used MDR-TB data collected from Hunan Chest Hospital, China and Gondar University Hospital, Ethiopia. The data were divided into derivation (n = 343; 60%) and validation groups (n = 227; 40%). A poor treatment outcome was defined as treatment failure, lost to follow up or death. A risk score for poor treatment outcomes was derived using a Cox proportional hazard model in the derivation group. The model was then validated in the validation group. RESULTS: The overall rate of poor treatment outcome was 39.5% (n = 225); 37.9% (n = 86) in the derivation group and 40.5% (n = 139) in the validation group. Three variables were identified as predictors of poor treatment outcomes, and each was assigned a number of points proportional to its regression coefficient. These predictors and their points were: 1) history of taking second-line TB treatment (2 points), 2) resistance to any fluoroquinolones (3 points), and 3) smear did not convert from positive to negative at two months (4 points). We summed these points to calculate the risk score for each patient; three risk groups were defined: low risk (0 to 2 points), medium risk (3 to 5 points), and high risk (6 to 9 points). In the derivation group, poor treatment outcomes were reported for these three groups as 14%, 27%, and 71%, respectively. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the point system in the derivation group was 0.69 (95% CI 0.60 to 0.77) and was similar to that in the validation group (0.67; 95% CI 0.56 to 0.78; p = 0.82). CONCLUSION: History of second-line TB treatment, resistance to any fluoroquinolones, and smear non-conversion at two months can be used to estimate the risk of poor treatment outcome in patients with MDR-TB with a moderate degree of accuracy (AUROC = 0.69)."," https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31899769"," Alene, K.

We assessed the cost-effectiveness of community-based LTBI screening and treatment strategies in recent migrants to a low-incidence setting (Australia). A decision-analytical Markov model was developed that cycled 1 migrant cohort (\u003E/=11-year-olds) annually over a lifetime from 2020. Postmigration/onshore and offshore (screening during visa application) strategies were compared with existing policy (chest x-ray during visa application). Outcomes included TB cases averted and discounted cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained from a health-sector perspective. Most recent migrants are young adults and cost-effectiveness is limited by their relatively low LTBI prevalence, low TB mortality risks, and high emigration probability. Onshore strategies cost at least $203,188 (Australian) per QALY gained, preventing approximately 2.3%-7.0% of TB cases in the cohort. Offshore strategies (screening costs incurred by migrants) cost at least $13,907 per QALY gained, preventing 5.5%-16.9% of cases. Findings were most sensitive to the LTBI treatment quality-of-life decrement (further to severe adverse events); with a minimal decrement, all strategies caused more ill health than they prevented. Additional LTBI strategies in recent migrants could only marginally contribute to TB elimination and are unlikely to be cost-effective unless screening costs are borne by migrants and potential LTBI treatment quality-of-life decrements are ignored."," https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34017976"," Dale, K.

METHODS: Information about TB patients was obtained from the BDH TB patient register for the period 26 April 2013 to 25 February 2017. The locations of TB patients were mapped, and the spatial scan statistic was used to identify high- and low-rate TB clusters in the BDH catchment area.

In the Gogodala region (Balimo Urban and Gogodala Rural LLGs), high-rate clusters occurred closer to the town of Balimo, while low-rate clusters were located in more remote regions. In addition, closer proximity to Balimo was a predictor of high-rate clustering. DISCUSSION: There is heterogeneity in the distribution of TB in the Balimo region.

METHODS: We projected the TB epidemic in Viet Nam and Lao People\u0027s Democratic Republic (PDR) 2020-2030 using a mathematical model under various scenarios: counterfactual (no TB care); baseline (TB care continues at current levels); and 12 different diagnosis and treatment interventions. We retrieved previous modeling results for China and the Philippines. We pooled the new and existing information on incidence and deaths in the four countries, covering \u003E80% of the TB burden in WPR. We estimated the return on investment of TB care and interventions in Viet Nam and Lao PDR using a Solow model. FINDINGS: In the baseline scenario, TB incidence in the four countries decreased from 97*0/100,000/year (2019) to 90*1/100,000/year (2030), and TB deaths from 83,300/year (2019) to 71,100/year (2030). Active case finding (ACF) strategies (screening people not seeking care for respiratory symptoms) were the most effective single interventions. Return on investment (2020-2030) for TB care in Viet Nam and Lao PDR ranged US$4-US$49/dollar spent; additional interventions brought up to US$2*7/dollar spent. INTERPRETATION: In the modeled countries, TB incidence will only modestly decrease without additional interventions. Interventions that include ACF can reduce TB burden but achieving the End TB incidence and mortality targets will be difficult without new transformational tools (e.g. vaccine, new diagnostic tools, shorter treatment). However, TB care, even at its current level, can bring a multiple-fold return on investment.

Collection of two sputum specimens is considered the minimum requirement for the diagnosis of PTB but current guidelines in the Torres Strait Islands, Australia, recommend three sputum specimens; this frequently delays treatment initiation. METHODS: A retrospective study was performed to ascertain the diagnostic yield of sputum specimens collected in the Torres Strait Islands. The study assessed demographics and characteristics of all PTB cases diagnosed between 2000 and 2018, and assessed the diagnostic yield in 143 patients from whom at least three sputum specimens had been collected prior to treatment commencement. Incremental and cumulative yield was calculated for each sputum specimen. Data were further analysed using binary logistic regression to examine the association between selected characteristics and a smear-positive acid-fast bacilli (AFB) result. RESULTS: Overall, AFB was detected from the first or second sputum specimen in 97 of 101 PTB cases that were sputum smear positive. A smear-positive result was more common (odds ratio 2.84, 95% confidence interval 1.08-7.46) for Papua New Guinea nationals compared to Australian born patients. Of the 429 samples collected, 76 (18%) were of poor quality and the association between poor quality specimens and smear-negative results was significant (p\u003C0.01). Among sputum smear-negative cases, 5/42 (12%) had three consecutive poor quality specimens. The most common collection modality in adults was voluntary expectoration; done in 391/429 (91%) of all specimens collected. Alternative specimen collection methods were mainly used in children; induced sputum 1/429 (0.2%), gastric aspirate 26/429 (6%) and nasopharyngeal aspirate 7/429 (1.6%). Errors with labelling, packaging and transportation occurred in 44 specimens from 15 patients. CONCLUSION: Two good quality specimens ensure adequate diagnostic yield for PTB and a third specimen should only be collected from patients with two negative specimens who have persistent symptoms.

METHODS: All laboratory-confirmed DR-TB cases diagnosed in the Torres Strait between 1 March 2000 and 31 March 2020 were reviewed. Total time from self-reported onset of symptoms to effective treatment commencement in different programmatic time periods was assessed. Pairwise analyses and time to event proportional hazard calculations were used to explore the association between delays in median time to effective treatment, and selected variables. Data were further analysed to examine predictors of excessive treatment delay. RESULTS: The median number of days from self-reported onset of symptoms to effective treatment commencement was 124 days (interquartile range 51-214) over two decades.

Although the National TB control program of Bangladesh is implementing a comprehensive expansion of TB control strategies, logistical challenges exist, and there is significant uncertainty concerning the disease burden. Mathematical modelling of TB is considered one of the most effective ways to understand the dynamics of infection transmission and allows quantification of parameters in different settings, including Bangladesh. In this study, we present a two-strain mathematical modelling framework to explore the dynamics of drug-susceptible (DS) and multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB in Bangladesh. We calibrated the model using DS and MDR-TB annual incidence data from Bangladesh from years 2001 to 2015. Further, we performed a sensitivity analysis of the model parameters and found that the contact rate of both strains had the largest influence on the basic reproduction numbers [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] of DS and MDR-TB, respectively. Increasingly powerful intervention strategies were developed, with realistic impact and coverage determined with the help of local staff. We simulated for the period from 2020 to 2035. Here, we projected the DS and MDR-TB burden (as measured by the number of incident cases and mortality) under a range of intervention scenarios to determine which of these scenario is the most effective at reducing burden. Of the single-intervention strategies, enhanced case detection is the most effective and prompt in reducing DS and MDR-TB incidence and mortality in Bangladesh and that with GeneXpert testing was also highly effective in decreasing the burden of MDR-TB. Our findings also suggest combining additional interventions simultaneously leads to greater effectiveness, particularly for MDR-TB, which we estimate requires a modest investment to substantially reduce, whereas DS-TB requires a strong sustained investment."," https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33623132"," Kuddus, M.

In this study, we developed a two strain TB mathematical model with amplification and fit it to the Bangladesh TB data to understand the transmission dynamics of DS and MDR TB. Sensitivity analysis was used to identify important parameters. We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of varying combinations of four basic control strategies including distancing, latent case finding, case holding and active case finding, all within the optimal control framework. From our fitting, the model with different transmission rates between DS and MDR TB best captured the Bangladesh TB reported case counts. The estimated basic reproduction number for DS TB was 1.14 and for MDR TB was 0.54, with an amplification rate of 0.011 per year. The sensitivity analysis also indicated that the transmission rates for both DS and MDR TB had the largest influence on prevalence. To reduce the burden of TB (both DS and MDR), our finding suggested that a quadruple control strategy that combines distancing control, latent case finding, case holding and active case finding is the most cost-effective. Alternative strategies can be adopted to curb TB depending on availability of resources and policy makers\u0027 decisions."," https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32702052"," Kuddus, M. A. Meehan, M.

METHODS: We considered the reports identified in a previous systematic review of studies from the prechemotherapy era, and extracted detailed data on mortality over time. We used a Bayesian framework to estimate the rates of TB-induced mortality and self-cure. A hierarchical model was employed to allow estimates to vary by cohort. Inference was performed separately for smear-positive TB (SP-TB) and smear-negative TB (SN-TB). RESULTS: We included 41 cohorts of SP-TB patients and 19 cohorts of pulmonary SN-TB patients in the analysis. The median estimates of the TB-specific mortality rates were 0.389 year-1 (95% credible interval [CrI], .335-.449) and 0.025 year-1 (95% CrI, .017-.035) for SP-TB and SN-TB patients, respectively. The estimates for self-recovery rates were 0.231 year-1 (95% CrI, .177-.288) and 0.130 year-1 (95% CrI, .073-.209) for SP-TB and SN-TB patients, respectively. These rates correspond to average durations of untreated TB of 1.57 years (95% CrI, 1.37-1.81) and 5.35 years (95% CrI, 3.42-8.23) for SP-TB and SN-TB, respectively, when assuming a non-TB-related mortality rate of 0.014 year-1 (ie, a 70-year life expectancy). CONCLUSIONS: TB-specific mortality rates are around 15 times higher for SP-TB than for SN-TB patients. This difference was underestimated dramatically in previous TB modeling studies, raising concerns about the accuracy of the associated predictions. Despite being less infectious, SN-TB may be responsible for equivalent numbers of secondary infections as SP-TB due to its much longer duration."," https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32766718"," Ragonnet, R.

The true age distribution of disease is unknown because a large proportion of individuals with active TB remain undetected. Understanding of transmission is limited by the asymptomatic nature of latent infection and the pathogen\u0027s capacity for late reactivation. A better understanding of TB epidemiology is critically needed to ensure effective use of existing and future control tools. METHODS: We use an agent-based model to simulate TB epidemiology in the five highest TB burden countries-India, Indonesia, China, the Philippines and Pakistan-providing unique insights into patterns of transmission and disease. Our model replicates demographically realistic populations, explicitly capturing social contacts between individuals based on local estimates of age-specific contact in household, school and workplace settings. Time-varying programmatic parameters are incorporated to account for the local history of TB control. RESULTS: We estimate that the 15-19-year-old age group is involved in more than 20% of transmission events in India, Indonesia, the Philippines and Pakistan, despite representing only 5% of the local TB incidence. According to our model, childhood TB represents around one fifth of the incident TB cases in these four countries. In China, three quarters of incident TB were estimated to occur in the \u003E/= 45-year-old population. The calibrated per-contact transmission risk was found to be similar in each of the five countries despite their very different TB burdens. CONCLUSIONS: Adolescents and young adults are a major driver of TB in high-incidence settings. Relying only on the observed distribution of disease to understand the age profile of transmission is potentially misleading."," https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31752895"," Ragonnet, R.

METHODS: We used a transmission dynamic model of TB informed by local data to capture the Marshall Islands epidemic\u0027s historical dynamics. We then used the model to project the future epidemic trajectory following the active screening interventions, as well as considering a counterfactual scenario with no intervention. We also simulated future scenarios including periodic interventions similar to those previously implemented, to assess their ability to reach the End TB Strategy targets and TB pre-elimination in the Marshall Islands. RESULTS: The screening activities conducted in 2017 and 2018 were estimated to have reduced TB incidence and mortality by around one-third in 2020, and are predicted to achieve the End TB Strategy milestone of 50% incidence reduction by 2025 compared with 2015. Screening interventions had a considerably greater impact when latent TB screening and treatment were included, compared with active case finding alone. Such combined programmes implemented at the national level could achieve TB pre-elimination around 2040 if repeated every 2 years. CONCLUSIONS: Our model suggests that it would be possible to achieve TB pre-elimination by 2040 in the Marshall Islands through frequent repetition of the same interventions as those already implemented in the country. It also highlights the importance of including latent infection testing in active screening activities."," https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/35323964"," Ragonnet, R. Williams, B. M. Largen, A.

METHODS: We updated previous systematic reviews of the effectiveness of BCG vaccination to 31 December 2020. We employed an identical search strategy and inclusion/exclusion criteria to these earlier reviews, but reclassified several studies, developed an alternative classification system and considered study demography, diagnostic approach and tuberculosis (TB)-related epidemiological context. MAIN RESULTS: Of 21 included trials, those recruiting neonates and children aged under 5 were consistent in demonstrating considerable protection against TB for several years. Trials in high-burden settings with shorter follow-up also showed considerable protection, as did most trials in settings of declining burden with longer follow-up. However, the few trials performed in high-burden settings with longer follow-up showed no protection, sometimes with higher case rates in the vaccinated than the controls in the later follow-up period. CONCLUSIONS: The most plausible explanatory hypothesis for these results is that BCG protects against TB that results from exposure shortly after vaccination. However, we found no evidence of protection when exposure occurs later from vaccination, which would be of greater importance in trials in high-burden settings with longer follow-up. In settings of declining burden, most exposure occurs shortly following vaccination and the sustained protection observed for many years thereafter represents continued protection against this early exposure. By contrast, in settings of continued intense transmission, initial protection subsequently declines with repeated exposure to Mycobacterium tuberculosis or other pathogens."," https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33893231"," Trauer, J.

Australia is a high-income country with a low burden of TB, which is particularly concentrated in migrant populations. As part of Australia\u0027s migration program, permanent, provisional and humanitarian visa applicants are screened for TB, along with some applicants for temporary visas. METHODS: We calculated the prevalence of all forms of active TB and bacteriologically-confirmed TB among onshore and offshore applicants for visas to Australia from July 2014 to June 2017, and investigated associated risk factors using logistic regression. FINDINGS: Visa applicants were predominantly young adults from various Asian countries. Among 2,381,217 applicants, 1263 cases of active TB were diagnosed, including 852 cases of bacteriologically-confirmed TB. Overall TB prevalence was 53.0 per 100,000, corresponding to one TB diagnosis for every 1887 applicants screened. TB rates increased with age and were higher among humanitarian applicants and those previously treated for TB, although most cases occurred in applicants without these risk factors. TB prevalence by country of origin was similar to WHO estimates for some countries, but considerably lower for others. For several highly represented countries of origin, rates appear to have fallen relative to earlier comparable studies. INTERPRETATION: Prevalence of TB among visa applicants to Australia and the consequent risk to the Australian community appear to be declining and remain low. In this context, support for TB control programs overseas and preventive interventions are likely to have the greatest impact on domestic TB burden.
